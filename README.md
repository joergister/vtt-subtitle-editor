A web-based tool for editing VTT (WebVTT) subtitle files with synchronized audio playback. Perfect for correcting transcription errors and speaker attributions in interview transcripts.

üåê **Live App**: https://joergister.github.io/vtt-subtitle-editor/

## Features

- **Synchronized Playback**: Play audio while viewing synchronized subtitles
- **Real-time Editing**: Edit subtitle text, speaker names, and timestamps on the fly
- **Speaker Dropdown**: Select speakers from a dropdown to prevent typos when changing attributions

## Use Case

This tool was created as a companion to **[transcribe-KIT](https://github.com/joergister/transcribe-KIT)** for editing automatically generated transcriptions. Machine learning transcription models sometimes make mistakes with:

- **Word accuracy**: Mishearing similar-sounding words
- **Speaker attribution**: Confusing speakers with similar voices
- **Technical terms**: Misinterpreting domain-specific vocabulary

The VTT Subtitle Editor lets you quickly correct these errors while listening to the audio, ensuring accurate transcripts for research interviews, meetings, or podcasts.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Editor**: Visit https://joergister.github.io/vtt-subtitle-editor/
2. **Load Files**:
   - Upload your audio file (M4A, MP3, WAV, etc.)
   - Upload your VTT subtitle file
3. **Play & Edit**:
   - Press play to start the audio
   - The current subtitle will be highlighted automatically
   - Edit text, change speaker, or adjust timestamps as needed
4. **Export**: Click "Export Modified VTT" to download your corrected transcript

## Integration with transcribe-KIT

After correcting your VTT file with this editor, convert it to clean dialogue format:

```bash
transcribe vtt-to-txt corrected_transcript.vtt final_dialogue.txt
```

This produces a readable text file like:
```

INTERVIEWER: What features did you find most useful?
