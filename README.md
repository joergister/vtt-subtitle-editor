## Use Case

This tool was created as a companion to **[transcribe-KIT](https://github.com/joergister/transcribe-KIT)** for editing automatically generated transcriptions. Machine learning transcription models sometimes make mistakes with:

- **Word accuracy**: Mishearing similar-sounding words

The VTT Subtitle Editor lets you quickly correct these errors while listening to the audio, ensuring accurate transcripts for research interviews, meetings, or podcasts.
